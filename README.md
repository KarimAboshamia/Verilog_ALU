# Verilog_ALU
Verilog program to implement ALU with the following operations: 
* Adding two N-bit numbers.
* Subtracting two N-bit numbers.
* Adding 1 to a N-bit number.
* Subtracting 1 from a N-bit number.
* Bitwise ANDing two N-bit numbers.
* Bitwise ORing two N-bit numbers.
* Bitwise XORing two N-bit numbers.
* Arithmetic shifting right of a N-bit number that will discard the least significant bit.
The output of the ALU will be a (N+1)-bit number, where the additional bit is the most significant one
